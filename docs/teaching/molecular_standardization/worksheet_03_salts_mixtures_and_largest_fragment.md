# Worksheet 03: Salts, Mixtures, and Largest Fragment Selection

## Context

Students investigate when largest fragment selection is helpful and when it may be chemically misleading.

## Widget

```text
Cheminf - Processing → Mol Standardizer
```

## Recommended input data

```text
examples/molecular_standardization/standardization_training_set.csv
examples/molecular_standardization/standardization_edge_cases.csv
```

## Intended learning outcomes

After this activity, students should be able to:

1. describe the relevant molecular standardization problem;
2. use the Mol Standardizer widget on a small chemical dataset;
3. interpret standardized SMILES and standardization logs;
4. decide whether the transformation is chemically appropriate for a given downstream task;
5. document the decision in a reproducible way.

## Orange workflow

```text
File → Mol Standardizer → Data Table
```

Optional extension:

```text
Mol Standardizer → Fingerprint Generator / Cyclic Registry Fingerprint / Mol Descriptors 2
```

## Student tasks

1. Filter the training set for `salt`, `mixture`, and `metal_complex` cases.
2. Run `Mol Standardizer` with LargestFragmentChooser on.
3. Repeat with LargestFragmentChooser off.
4. Compare `SMILES_STD` for sodium salts and artificial mixtures.
5. Decide which output should be used for QSAR and which should be preserved for provenance.

## Guiding questions

- Why are salts common in chemical databases?
- When is the largest organic fragment a good approximation of the parent compound?
- When could largest-fragment selection remove chemically important information?

## Expected outputs

Students should produce:

- a table containing original and standardized SMILES;
- a short list of changed, unchanged, and failed molecules;
- interpretation of at least two standardization logs;
- a brief explanation of whether the standardized output is suitable for QSAR, fingerprinting, docking, or registry matching.

## Assessment rubric

| Criterion | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Data loading | Not completed | Loaded with errors | Loaded correctly | Loaded and inspected carefully |
| Widget use | Not used | Used with unclear settings | Used correctly | Settings compared and justified |
| Chemical interpretation | Missing | Superficial | Mostly correct | Chemically well justified |
| Reproducibility | Missing | Minimal notes | Settings documented | Settings, limitations, and failed cases documented |

## Teacher notes

Emphasize that molecular standardization is not a universal truth-generating step. It is a protocol. Different scientific questions may require different protocols. Students should learn to preserve the original structure, inspect logs, and avoid silent changes.
